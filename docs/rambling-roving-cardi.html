					Rambling Roving is a woolly and whimsical winter cardigan. Worked 
					in raglan construction, the cardigan is worn with a shrug fit. Bubble 
					sleeves add volume to the arms and cinch at the wrist for mobility. 
					Textural patterning is explored through the use of single-ply bulky 
					yarn, color-blocking, and a two-color brioche stitch hem. The result 
					is a unique, custom garment that evokes a pastoral landscape.
