					From landscapes split by geopolitical lines to the individual psychological 
					experience of blocked mobility, the experience of the border condition 
					traverses every scale of the built environment. As symbolic objects, borders 
					present false binaries between danger and safety, interior and exterior, 
					inclusion and exclusion. Borders are highly politicized and hyper-surveilled 
					sites, typically represented as opaque lines on a map or floor plan. This 
					linear condition appears solid and permanent, yet it is always open to 
					possibilities of change or destruction.

					Stitch it Together challenges the narrative of the border as permanent, 
					binary, and impervious through a critique of traditional representational 
					practices at the scale of the body, the building, the landscape, and the 
					digital. The work is sited across the charged space of the US-Mexico 
					border line, which splits a continental tapestry intimately connected by 
					ecology, infrastructure, and migratory systems. Alternative counter-mapping 
					proposals offer the construction of new frameworks for an interconnected 
					and interdependent region. A distributed textile collective forms the 
					production model for a series of designed political objects to soften and 
					subvert the border condition at the scale of human, infrastructural, and 
					celestial bodies. In equal embrace of technology and craft, these objects 
					lean into opportunities for disruption as opened by the technological glitch.
