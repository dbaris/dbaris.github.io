I believe all aspects of this project have been implemented correctly. My website includes 3 separate pages (index.html, bio.html, resume.html), and it can be accessed through the url: dbaris.github.io. All design elements are located in css files, not within the HTML. Each html and css file passes without errors when run through the validator. 

Time Spent:
===========
Approximately 6 hours

Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
